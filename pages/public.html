				So, what&rsquo;s up with TheatreJS?
			</h1>

		</header>

		<div class="article-content">

			<p>
				It allows web designers and developers to create animation on the web. They'd use it to create interactive web-based movies, ads, apps, and games.
			</p>

			<div id="filmSpace" class="filmSpace"></div>


			<p>
				Now, it's easy to create "animation" on the web, but it's hard to create something that's engaging. With the platform and today's toolset, it's hard to make something that really exploits the real power of animation.
			</p>

			<h2>Animation is different than text</h2>

			<p>
				Here is the thing: animation is a completely different medium than text. Because unlike text, animation, can instantly grab the viewer's attention. You can create this world where the viewer can actually experience your story.
			</p>

			<p>
				And you can be theatrical, you can talk to their senses, so that they feel your message... and they get it... and they remember it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Real animation can be so much more powerful than text. It's a whole new way for people to express themselves on the web.
			</p>

			<h2>
				The prototype
			</h2>

			<p>
				We wanted to see if high-perf animation and is possible with today's web technology, and, well, it was. We made demoscenes, motion typography, presentations, all kinds of stuff.
			</p>

			<p>
				And that was great, but then at that point, the next question was can this kind of animation really convey messages in a better way. Can it drive conversion and sales, if you may.
			</p>

			<h2>
				In public
			</h2>

			<p>
				So we turned to TheatreJS, we made a presentation. Our animation was super simple, nontheless we worked on the story, on the sound, the flow of events, we wanted to really exploit the power of animation, while sticking to the limited timeframe.
			</p>

			<p>
				And uh, it created all this conversation on social media that not only showed how successful that animation was in showcasing Griddify, but also, amazingly, how many developers were actually anticipating and waiting for a web-based animation tool like this to come along.
			</p>

			<h2>
				The competition
			</h2>

			<p>
				Bare in mind that all these people knew about Flash and its alternatives like Edge. But the prospect of something like TheatreJS is exciting because it does what the competition fundamentally cannot do:
			</p>

			<p>
				TheatreJS is not an animation suite, it's an animation <em>component</em>. It doesn't <em>care</em> if your content is 2D or 3D, if it's cartoonish or photorealistic, if it's on the web or even in a native app. Put more simply, TheatreJS doesn't get involved in how to render those things.
